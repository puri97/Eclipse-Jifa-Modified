# Eclipse Jifa

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-EPL%202.0-green.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/EPL-2.0)

[Eclipse Jifa](https://eclipse.org/jifa) is open-source software for better troubleshooting common problems that occurred in Java applications.

Many of the useful tools are client-based. When faced with problems in the production environment or the cloud environment, such tools cannot be used directly due to network or resource problems. Jifa provides a web solution, allowing developers to use the browser to troubleshoot.

The following features are supported:

- [Heap Dump Analysis](backend/heap-dump-analyzer/README.md)

- [GC Log Analysis](backend/gc-log-analyzer/README.md)

- [Thread Dump Analysis](backend/thread-dump-analyzer/README.md)

The backend of Jifa uses Vert.x as the main framework and consists of two modules:

- Master
    - manage workers and route the requests from browser to the workers
- Worker
    - do the real analysis work
  
The frontend of Jifa uses Vue as the main framework.

## Getting Started

### Build

- Prerequisites
  - JDK 11+, and make sure $JAVA_HOME is set properly

  - npm

- Build All
  
  ```bash
  $ ./gradlew buildJifa
  ```

- Build Worker Only

  ```bash
  $ ./gradlew buildWorker
  ```

### Run & Deploy

- Master & Worker

  - Default pattern
    ```bash
    $ cd deploy/default_pattern
    $ ./deploy_jifa.sh
    ```

  - K8S pattern, workers are scheduled by K8S
    ```bash
    $ cd deploy/k8s_pattern
    $ ./deploy.sh
    ```
    
- Worker Only
  ```bash
  $ cd deploy
  $ ./depoy_worker.sh
  ```

See [deployment document](deploy/README.md) for more details.

## Quick Demo

```bash
$ docker pull jifadocker/jifa-worker:demo
$ docker run -p 8102:8102 jifadocker/jifa-worker:demo
```

**Note:**  if running Apple's M1 Max chip, include the `--platform linux/amd64` switch after the `run` command.

Then, you can visit Jifa at `http://localhost:8102`
